### Description

Yet another lame installment of simple effects.. this one uses lines and labels to simulate a button of different shapes.. i believe ive commented it enough for basic understanding (not like its complicated). So check it out, leave a flame, and have a coke and a smile..... ;)
 
### More Info
 
Assuming you have a computer, VB installed, and have more or less aquired basic reading/writing skills,

you should be all set.

Although i've labeled this as VB6 code,

it should work in other versions, provided

that you edit the retained line..

A sense of pride and self-satisfaction to know that you're better than i am.

You might devolope a psycological condition from

your unresolved hate towards me, but the acutal

risk is quite minimal.. just breathe deeply,

count to 10 and leave a nasty message, i'm sure

it will pass... ;)
